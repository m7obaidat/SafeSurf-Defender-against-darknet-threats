Considering the rapid growth of the Darknet in different networking applications, the significance of related threats is amplified, which highlights the importance of security for identifying and mitigating such darknet-related threats. Despite ongoing research in monitoring darknet traffic, identifying and preventing malicious traffic is still challenging. The study explores supervised learning techniques in intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to improve their effectiveness and accuracy in identifying and preventing darknet threats. Our research aims to enhance IPS for denying darknet threats by implementing advanced supervised techniques, learning from historical patterns, and adapting to new threats in real time.
